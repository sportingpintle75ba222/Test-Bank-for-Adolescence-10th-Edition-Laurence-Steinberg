  * In this tenth edition of Adolescence, Laurence Steinberg continues to utilize an effective combination of a friendly writing style, thorough research, and a contextual approach that emphasizes adolescence in contemporary society. The text's careful organization ensures maximum teaching flexibility that allows the chapters to work together to be covered in sequence or to stand alone. Ethnicity and minority issues are thoroughly discussed in a way that enables students to see how the adolescent experience is shaped by class and culture. The strong pedagogical framework helps students organize and integrate material. Thoroughly updated to reflect current findings in the field of adolescent development, Adolescence is based on solid research and theory, yet it has a distinctively "real world" feel that emphasizes the reality of being an adolescent in today's society.
